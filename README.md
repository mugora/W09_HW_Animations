# W09_HW_Animations


    Create a worm. The worm stretches across each side, going from a side to the top or bottom, to the other side, then the top or bottom that was not touched. (See Gif)
    The Worm by default is 100 by 100 px
    The worm is inside of a container that is 500px by 500px
    The box should stretch the entire side that its currently on and then shrink into its original 100 by 100 size before going to stretch to the other side
    Should be an infinite animation
    When stretching, the worm should slim to half of its thickness
